%Regular expressions (regexes) are powerful tools employed across many tasks and platforms. Regexes can be very complex and prior work has shown that developers find regexes to be difficult to compose and understand. 
The regular expression (regex) is a powerful tool employed in a large variety of tasks. Prior work has shown that regexes can be very complex and that it could be difficult for developers to compose and understand them. 
%Due to a rich feature set, there is more than one way to compose a regex to get the same desired behavior. 

In order to identify the code smells which impact comprehension, we conducted an empirical study on dozens of pairs of behaviorally equivalent but syntactically different regexes among 180 participants and evaluated the understandability of various regex language features. We found that some regex expression representations are more understandable than others. For example, our study showed that in expressing one or more repetitions of a character the plus (e.g., \verb!`a+'!) operator is more understandable than the kleene star operator (e.g., \verb!`aa*'!). We further analyzed regexes in GitHub to find the community standards, or the common usages of various features. Finally, we identified smelly and non-smelly regex representations based on a combination of community standards and understandability metrics. We also formed recommendations on how to transform regexes to enhance comprehension.

%Regular expressions (regexes) are powerful tools employed across many tasks and platforms. Regexes can be very complex and prior work has shown that developers find regexes to be difficult to compose and understand. Due to a rich feature set, there is more than one way to compose a regex to get the same desired behavior. With the goal of finding potential transformations that improve regex comprehension, we conducted an empirical study with 180 participants and 36 pairs of behaviorally equivalent but syntactically different regexes, and evaluate the understandability of various regex language features. We found that, for example,  patterns requiring one or more  repetitions of a character are more understandable when expressed using the plus (e.g., `:+') operator than the kleene star operator   (e.g., `::*'). We further analyze regexes in GitHub to find community standards, or common usages of various features. Finally, we identify preferred representations based on a combination of community standards and understandability metrics, and form recommendations on how to transform regexes to enhance comprehension.
