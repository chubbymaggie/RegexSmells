\todoMid{We are building on the survey that indicates regexes are hard to read, and the apparent lack of any regex readability refactoring attempts.  Many papers have talked about refactoring, basically it is changing the form but not the behavior.}


Prior work that surveyed developers about regex usage found that in a small software company, the 18 surveyed developers compose an average of 172 regexes per year. This is 48\% higher than the number of regexes composed annually by MTurk participants in this work, which may be due to the nature of the jobs performed by the two populations.
