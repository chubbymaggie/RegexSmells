\section{Conclusion}
In an effort to find refactorings that improve the understandability of regexes, we created five equivalence class models and used these models to investigate the most common representations and most comprehensible representations.  We found the most common representations per group by both number of patterns and number of projects to be C1, D2, T1 and S2 (L3 is in the most patterns, L2 is in the most projects).
We also identified three strongly preferred transformations between representations (i.e., $\overrightarrow{T4 T1}$, $\overrightarrow{D2 D3}$, and  $\overrightarrow{L2 L3}$) according to the results of our comprehension tests.  We combined the results of these two investigations using a version of Kahn's topological sorting algorithm to produce a total ordering of representations within each model.
